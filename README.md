**Project Overview:- Power BI Dashboard for Road Accident Analysis**


1. Introduction

Road accidents are a major public safety concern, with various factors influencing their frequency and severity. This project utilizes Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard that analyzes road accident data, helping to identify trends, key risk factors, and opportunities for improving road safety.

2. Dashboard Objectives

The primary goals of the Power BI dashboard include:

Providing real-time insights into road accidents and casualties.

Identifying trends in accident counts and severity levels.

Analyzing accident distribution based on vehicle types, road types, and weather conditions.

Helping policymakers and transportation authorities make data-driven decisions for accident prevention.

3. Key Metrics & Visualizations

The dashboard presents multiple KPIs and visualizations, including:

Total Casualties (CY Casualties) – Number of casualties in the current year.

Year-over-Year (YoY) Casualties – Percentage change in casualties compared to the previous year.

Total Accident Count – Number of reported accidents.

Casualties by Vehicle Type – Breakdown of accidents involving cars, buses, motorcycles, vans, etc.

Casualties by Light Condition – Analysis of accidents occurring in daylight vs. darkness.

Casualties by Road Type – Accidents occurring on single carriageways, dual carriageways, roundabouts, etc.

Weather Condition Impact – Influence of weather conditions (e.g., fine weather, fog, or snow) on accidents.

Geographic Distribution – Breakdown of accidents by district.

4. Insights & Key Findings

Urban areas report a higher number of casualties than rural areas.

Daylight accidents account for the majority, but nighttime accidents tend to be more severe.

Cars are involved in the highest number of accidents, followed by motorcycles and vans.

Poor weather conditions (fog, snow) contribute to a higher accident rate.

Roundabouts and slip roads have fewer accidents compared to dual carriageways.



**Conclusion:-**


The Power BI dashboard successfully visualizes key accident statistics, helping authorities and policymakers understand accident trends and identify areas requiring intervention. The insights generated can contribute to road safety awareness and proactive measures for reducing accidents.
